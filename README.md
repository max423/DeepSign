ASL orthography is a part of American Sign Language (ASL) used to represent and communicate the spelling of words. In ASL spelling, each letter of the alphabet is represented by a specific hand sign.
 
People use ASL speeling to communicate and understand specific words, proper names or technical terms that may not have a dedicated ASL sign.

ASL spelling consists of 26 distinct signs, corresponding to the letters of the English alphabet. Each sign represents a specific letter and is performed with the hands in different positions and movements. The correct representation of letters through ASL spelling is important to ensure accurate and clear communication.
